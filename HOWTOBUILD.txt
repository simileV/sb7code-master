OpenGL SuperBible 7th Edition Examples - How to Build
=====================================================

This source code archive uses CMake to build. The samples also use GLFW library, a
snapshot of which is included in the `extern` folder. It's also possible to use a different
copy of GLFW if desired, but that's an excercise for you. Instructions for each supported
platform are as follows:

Windows / Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
--------------------------------------

Install CMake. Windows binaries are available from http://www.cmake.org/.
Ensure that CMake is in your path.
Open a command prompt and change to the directory where you've checked out the code.

### Build GLFW

If you are going to use the copy of GLFW included in the archive, enter the
GLFW directory in `extern/glfw-3.0.4`, and type:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" .

(Yes, that's not a mistake - Visual Studio 12 is 2013)

Open the resulting GLFW.sln file in Visual Studio and build both the debug and release configurations.

Copy and rename the resulting glfw3 libraries:

* Copy `glfw-3.0.4/src/Debug/glfw3.lib` into the `lib` directory and **rename it to glfw3_d.lib**.
* Copy `glf3-3.0.4/src/Release/glfw3.lib` into the `lib` directory but don't rename it.

### Build the samples

Open a command prompt and change to the build directory in the source archive.
Type:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A ..
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ..
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ../"
 
 
 
Open the resulting superbible7.sln project in Visual Studio.

The examples will build into the `bin` directory.


Running the samples
-------------------

*This part is really important. Please read it!*

Most of the samples require some media files. The media files package is a
separate download available from http://www.openglsuperbible.com and is
rougly 100MB of textures, object files and shader code. Unpack the archive
to the bin/media directory before trying to run these samples.
